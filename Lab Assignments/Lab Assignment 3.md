## Task 1: Install Configure and Run Wireshark

Wireshark is a valuable tool commonly used by IT professionals to monitor network traffic. It can be used by network administrators to troubleshoot issues or bad actors to steal unencrypted information. In this task we will be installing & configuring wireshark and seeing it's capabilities.

### Installing Wireshark

Open your Linux VM and launch the terminal. Run the following commands to install Wireshark:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install wireshark -y
```
Once you run the last command, your terminal should automatically open a prompt that ask you if non-superusers should be able to capture packets. Make sure NO is selected and press enter. You should now be able to launch wireshark by typing in `sudo wireshark`.

#### Error Correction

If you run into the error `couldn't run /usr/bin/dumpcap in child process: Permission Denied`, then you need to run the following command:
``` bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
```
This time, select YES. This creates a special wireshark group. Now that the group is created, then you need to add your user account to the group. Type in the following command:
```bash
sudo adduser $USER wireshark
```
Restart your VM and launch wireshark through the terminal.

### Capturing Traffic

Follow these steps to start capturing network traffic.
1. Open Firefox or a similar web browser to verify internet connectivity
1. On Wireshark, select Capture > Options
1. Uncheck "Enable promiscious mode on all interfaces" and then select "enp0s3"
1. Click start
1. Switch back to Firefox and go to a website, like the Wikepedia article for Wireshark.
1. Once the webpage finishes loading, switch back to Wireshark. Your screen should something like this:

Now you have successfully completed installing & configuring wireshark!
