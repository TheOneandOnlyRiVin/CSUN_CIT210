## Task 1: Install Configure and Run Wireshark

Wireshark is a valuable tool commonly used by IT professionals to monitor network traffic. It can be used by network administrators to troubleshoot issues or bad actors to steal unencrypted information. In this task we will be installing & configuring wireshark and seeing it's capabilities.

### Installing Wireshark

Open your Linux VM and launch the terminal. Run the following commands to install Wireshark:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install wireshark -y
```
Once you run the last command, your terminal should automatically open a prompt that ask you if non-superusers should be able to capture packets. Make sure NO is selected and press enter. You should now be able to launch wireshark by typing in `sudo wireshark`.

If you run into the error `couldn't run /usr/bin/dumpcap in child process: Permission Denied`, check in details. Otherwise, continue to Capturing Traffic. 

<details>

On your Linux Terminal, type in the following bash commands:
``` bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
```
This time, select YES. This creates a special wireshark group. Now that the group is created, then you need to add your user account to the group. Type in the following command:
```bash
sudo adduser $USER wireshark
```
Restart your VM and launch wireshark through the terminal.
</details>

### Capturing Traffic

Follow these steps to start capturing network traffic.
1. Open Firefox or a similar web browser to verify internet connectivity
1. On Wireshark, select Capture > Options
1. Uncheck "Enable promiscious mode on all interfaces" and then select "enp0s3"
1. Click start
1. Switch back to Firefox and go to a website, like the Wikepedia article for Wireshark.
1. Once the webpage finishes loading, switch back to Wireshark and stop capturing. Your screen should something like this:

![Wireshark Traffic Example Task 1](/Pictures/Task1_Wireshark.png)

Now you have successfully completed installing & configuring wireshark!

## Task 2: Capturing Web Traffic Using Wireshark

1. Open wireshark and start capturing traffic like you did in the last task.
1. Open Firefox and go to neverssl.com
1. Once the website finishes loading, go back to Wireshark and stop capturing. 

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you launch Firefox before you start recording to limit the amount of web traffic that gets captured.

4. Once you stop capturing packets, scroll to the top of the list and look for the first HTTP frame. You will find the information regarding the HTTP version used, the browser the user accessed the site from.
1. At the bottom of the HTTP field in the frame, it should list which frame contains the response. That frame contains information about the applications running on the server.

## Task 3: Basic Apache Configuration

The Apache HTTP Server (“httpd”) is the most commonly used web server on Linux systems. It is used to host most of the smaller-medium sized websites on the internet (including neverssl.com).

### Exercise 1: Installation and Basic Configuration of the Apache Web Server

Before we install Apache, we should first make sure it is not already installed. To do that, run the following bash command:
```bash
apt-cache policy apache2
```
You should see in the text that was written back to the CLI `Installed: (none)`. That means that it is not installed. Which means it's time to install it. Run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y # you already want to make sure you update/upgrade before installing anything!
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```
You can now run the `apt-cache...` command again to verify that it was successfully installed.
