## Task 1: Install Configure and Run Wireshark

Wireshark is a valuable tool commonly used by IT professionals to monitor network traffic. It can be used by network administrators to troubleshoot issues or bad actors to steal unencrypted information. In this task we will be installing & configuring wireshark and seeing it's capabilities.

### Installing Wireshark

Open your Linux VM and launch the terminal. Run the following commands to install Wireshark:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install wireshark -y
```
Once you run the last command, your terminal should automatically open a prompt that ask you if non-superusers should be able to capture packets. Make sure NO is selected and press enter. You should now be able to launch wireshark by typing in `sudo wireshark`.

If you run into the error `couldn't run /usr/bin/dumpcap in child process: Permission Denied`, check in details. Otherwise, continue to Capturing Traffic. 

<details>

On your Linux Terminal, type in the following bash commands:
``` bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
```
This time, select YES. This creates a special wireshark group. Now that the group is created, then you need to add your user account to the group. Type in the following command:
```bash
sudo adduser $USER wireshark
```
Restart your VM and launch wireshark through the terminal.
</details>

### Capturing Traffic

Follow these steps to start capturing network traffic.
1. Open Firefox or a similar web browser to verify internet connectivity
1. On Wireshark, select Capture > Options
1. Uncheck "Enable promiscious mode on all interfaces" and then select "enp0s3"
1. Click start
1. Switch back to Firefox and go to a website, like the Wikepedia article for Wireshark.
1. Once the webpage finishes loading, switch back to Wireshark and stop capturing. Your screen should something like this:

![Wireshark Traffic Example Task 1](/Pictures/Task1_Wireshark.png)

Now you have successfully completed installing & configuring wireshark!

## Task 2: Capturing Web Traffic Using Wireshark

1. Open wireshark and start capturing traffic like you did in the last task.
1. Open Firefox and go to neverssl.com
1. Once the website finishes loading, go back to Wireshark and stop capturing. 

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you launch Firefox before you start recording to limit the amount of web traffic that gets captured.

4. Once you stop capturing packets, scroll to the top of the list and look for the first HTTP frame. You will find the information regarding the HTTP version used, the browser the user accessed the site from.
1. At the bottom of the HTTP field in the frame, it should list which frame contains the response. That frame contains information about the applications running on the server.

## Task 3: Basic Apache Configuration

The Apache HTTP Server (“httpd”) is the most commonly used web server on Linux systems. It is used to host most of the smaller-medium sized websites on the internet (including neverssl.com).

### Exercise 1: Installation and Basic Configuration of the Apache Web Server

Before we install Apache, we should first make sure it is not already installed. To do that, run the following bash command:
```bash
apt-cache policy apache2
```
You should see in the text that was written back to the CLI `Installed: (none)`. That means that it is not installed. Which means it's time to install it. Run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y # you already want to make sure you update/upgrade before installing anything!
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```
You can now run the `apt-cache...` command again to verify that it was successfully installed.

### Exercise 2: Locating Key Apache Files and Folders

Here are the locations of the key files & folders for the Apache service.

#### Apache Reference Manual

`/use/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz`

#### Apache Configuration File

`/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`

#### Document Root

`/usr/share/apache2/build.`

#### Error Documents Directory

`/usr/share/apache2/error/.`

#### Log files

`/var/log/apache2/.`

#### The Apache daemon (executable)
`/usr/sbin/apache2`

### Exercise 3: Configure and Run Apache Web Server

To start the apache web server, run the following bash commands:
```bash
sudo service apache2 start
sudo service apache2 status
```
The output should say apache2.service is active. You will now further verify that it is working properly by checking the network activity using `netstat`. Run the following command to check for all network activity of the apache web server:
```bash
sudo netstat -npl | grep apache
```
Your output should look something like this:
```
tcp6    0       0 :::80           :::*               LISTEN
776/apache2
```

## Task 4: Install, Configure Connect FTP Server & Record Traffic Using Wireshark

### Installing & Configuring the FileZilla Server

Filezilla is an open source FTP software that supports both Linux & Windows. It works through a server-client system, where there is a server that hosts the files and a client that can retrieve them. Our first step for configuring FileZilla is going to be installing the FileZila server. To do this you are going to need to launch your Windows VM.

Once you have your Windows Server VM open follow the below steps:
1. Download FileZilla for server by following the link [here](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server).
1. Launch the installer once it's downloaded
1. Make sure "full" is selected for the installation type and select next > next > next > next.
1. When it asks for you to set the administration password, choose something easy to remeber.
1. Click next > install
1. Click okay, then copy the SHA256 fingerprint to your clipboard, then select close
1. Open notepad and paste the fingerprint there.
1. Go to the FileZilla administration interface and select "connect to server"
1. Enter the password you had entered before and connect
1. Click yes when it asks you about the fingerprint.

Now that you have the server installed, you need to configure it. Follow the below steps:
1. Click Server > Network configuration Wizard
1. Click next and make sure Any is selected
1. Leave the box blank and click next again
1. Click Finish

You have now set up and configured the FileZilla Server

<!-- TO BE DELETED
    IP addy: 10.0.2.6
    Listening port for FileZilla: 14148
    Password used: SambaT1me
    Certificate fingerprint: 40:2c:1f:96:3a:d5:34:3f:ac:43:3b:16:81:a3:cf:bc:5d:f8:c7:e9:87:fc:b0:3b:ad:6d:f4:18:51:67:be:6f
-->

### Installing & Configuring the FileZilla client

Switch back to your Linux VM and run the below terminal commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install filezilla -y
```
Once that finishes installing you can verify the installation by running the command `filezilla --version`. Find the application in the applications menu and launch it. 

Once it's open, follow the below steps to configure it & connect to the server:
1. Go to Edit > "Network Configuration Wizard"
1. Click next
1. Make sure the settings on the next window is set to passive and that the "allow fallback..." box is checked, then click next.
1. Make sure "Use the server's external..." is selected and then click next
1. Select "Use the following IP Address" and input the address of the Windows Server VM.Click next.
    > [!WARNING]
    > On FileZilla Server, is says you are connected to 127.0.0.1. That is not the Windows Server IP address. 
1. Make sure "Ask OS for a port is selected" and then click next.
