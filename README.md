# CSUN_CIT210
Hello everyone! My name is RiVin. I created this repo because I wasn't satisfied with the professor's vague instructions for the labs and wanted a place where we could help each other succeed. I also wanted to create something that would last longer than a discord so future classes can use this knowledge to help them.

## Guide
- [Lab Assignments](https://github.com/TheOneandOnlyRiVin/CSUN_CIT210/tree/main/Lab%20Assigments): Step-by-step instructions for the various labs
- [Slides](https://github.com/TheOneandOnlyRiVin/CSUN_CIT210/tree/main/Slides): Copies of all the professors slides in one location
- [Misc](https://github.com/TheOneandOnlyRiVin/CSUN_CIT210/tree/main/Misc): The textbook for the class as well as other useful guides

## Contributions
I can't do all the work myself. So if you have notes on a lecture you would like to share, a correction/addendum to one of the instructions, or just something you think should be in here, I encourage you to create a pull request and add it in.
