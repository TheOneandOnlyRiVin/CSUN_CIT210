Assignment 3:  Operating System: Virtualization, Containers and Cloud Computing, System Monitoring  (100 Points) Exercise 1 : (15 Points) 
1. What Is The Difference Between Emulation, Native Virtualization, And Para Virtualization ?  
(3 points) 
1. **Emulation:**
   - Emulation involves mimicking the functionality of one system on another system that is fundamentally different.
   - In emulation, the entire hardware environment is simulated, including CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
   - It is often used when running software designed for one platform on another platform where it would not normally run.
   - Emulation tends to be slower than native execution because it requires translation of instructions from the emulated system to the host system.

2. **Native Virtualization:**
   - Native virtualization, also known as full virtualization, involves running multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine.
   - It utilizes a hypervisor, which is a software layer that abstracts the underlying hardware and creates virtual machines (VMs) that each have their own virtualized hardware environment.
   - The guest operating systems running on VMs are unaware that they are not running directly on physical hardware.
   - Native virtualization provides good performance and efficiency because most instructions are executed directly on the underlying hardware, with only privileged instructions being intercepted and handled by the hypervisor.

3. **Para-virtualization:**
   - Para-virtualization is a technique where the guest operating system is modified to be aware of the virtualized environment.
   - Unlike native virtualization, where guest OSes are unaware of the virtualization layer, para-virtualization requires modification of the guest OS kernel to communicate with the hypervisor.
   - This communication allows for more efficient use of resources and can lead to better performance compared to full virtualization, especially in terms of I/O operations.
   - However, para-virtualization requires modification of the guest OS, which may not always be feasible or desirable, and it typically requires a specific hypervisor that supports para-virtualized guests.


2. What is Type-1 and Type-2 hypervisor ? What are different hypervisors available in Linux ?  
(3 points) 
1. Type-1 and Type-2 Hypervisors:

2.	What is Virtual Machine Snapshots? 
Virtual Machine Snapshots:

Virtual machine snapshots are a feature in virtualization platforms that allow users to capture the state of a virtual machine (VM) at a specific point in time. Essentially, a snapshot is a read-only copy of the VM's disk file and memory state at the moment the snapshot was taken. 

Snapshots enable users to revert the VM to a previous state quickly, effectively creating a point-in-time backup or checkpoint. They are particularly useful for several purposes:

1. Testing and Development: Snapshots allow developers to experiment with software configurations or updates without the risk of permanently altering the VM. If something goes wrong, they can revert to the snapshot and start over.

2. Backup and Recovery: Snapshots serve as a form of backup for VMs. If the VM becomes corrupted or experiences issues, administrators can revert to a snapshot to restore its previous state.

3. Rollback: In production environments, snapshots can be used to roll back changes that negatively impact system performance or stability. This can help minimize downtime and disruptions.

It's essential to understand that while snapshots provide flexibility and convenience, they are not a replacement for regular backups. Snapshots consume disk space, and maintaining numerous snapshots over an extended period can impact performance and increase storage requirements. Additionally, snapshots capture only the VM's disk and memory state, so they may not capture changes made to external resources or databases.

Overall, virtual machine snapshots are a valuable tool for managing and protecting virtualized environments, providing users with the ability to experiment, recover, and maintain system integrity.
3.	What is virtual Machine Cloning? What are the types of cloning in virtualization? 
Virtual Machine Cloning:

Virtual machine cloning is the process of creating an exact copy or replica of an existing virtual machine (VM). Cloning allows users to quickly deploy multiple instances of the same VM configuration without manually configuring each one. This can save time and effort, especially in environments where identical VMs are required.

Types of Cloning in Virtualization:

1. Full Clone:
   - A full clone creates a complete copy of the original VM, including its virtual disks, configuration settings, and memory state (if the VM is powered on).
   - Each full clone operates independently of the original VM, with its own unique identifier and virtual hardware configuration.
   - Full clones are suitable for scenarios where a completely isolated instance of the VM is needed, such as for testing or development purposes.

2. Linked Clone:
   - A linked clone creates a new VM that shares virtual disks with the original VM through snapshot technology.
   - Only the differences between the original VM and the clone are stored, reducing storage space requirements.
   - Linked clones rely on the snapshot chain of the original VM and require the original VM to be available.
   - Linked clones are useful for deploying multiple instances of the same VM quickly while conserving disk space.
4.	What are the differences between virtualization and containerization ?

Exercise 6 : Linux Monitoring (10 Points) 
 
a.	You need to track events on your system. What will you do? 
b.	How will you restrict IP so that the restricted IP’s may not use the FTP Server? 
c.	What is the difference between name based virtual hosting and IP based virtual hosting? 
d.	After upgrading kernel the machine fails to boot, what will you do? 
e.	On my Centos setup the rsyslog service fails to start but the problem is once the rsyslog server fails I do not get any messages in /var/log/messages hence I am unable to debug or find the problem why the rsyslog service is failing. Where should I check my system messages in such scenarios? 

a. To track events on the system, you can utilize system logging facilities such as syslog or systemd journal. You can configure these services to capture various types of events and store them in log files for later analysis. Additionally, you can use monitoring tools like Nagios, Zabbix, or Prometheus to monitor system metrics and generate alerts based on predefined thresholds.

b. To restrict IP access to the FTP server, you can utilize firewall rules. Assuming you're using iptables, you can create a rule to block specific IP addresses from accessing the FTP port (usually port 21). Here's an example command to block an IP address:

   iptables -A INPUT -s <restricted_ip_address> -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP

   Replace <restricted_ip_address> with the IP address you want to block.

c. Name-based virtual hosting and IP-based virtual hosting are two methods used to host multiple websites on a single server.

   Name-based virtual hosting: This method allows hosting multiple websites on the same IP address, but differentiating them based on the domain name requested by the client. The server uses the "Host" header in the HTTP request to determine which website to serve.

   IP-based virtual hosting: With IP-based virtual hosting, each website has its own unique IP address. The server uses the IP address of the incoming request to determine which website to serve. This method requires each website to have its own IP address.

d. If the machine fails to boot after upgrading the kernel, you can try the following steps:
   1. Boot into a rescue or live CD/USB.
   2. Mount the root filesystem of your installed system.
   3. Check the boot log and system logs for any errors that occurred during boot.
   4. Roll back to the previous kernel version if possible.
   5. If the issue persists, troubleshoot any errors encountered during boot, such as missing drivers or misconfigured bootloader settings.

e. If the rsyslog service fails to start and you're not seeing any messages in /var/log/messages, you can check the systemd journal for error messages related to rsyslog. Use the following command to view the systemd journal:

   journalctl -xe | grep rsyslog

   This command will display any logs related to rsyslog and may provide clues as to why the service is failing to start. Additionally, you can check other system logs in /var/log for any relevant error messages that could help diagnose the issue.
 
Exercise 7 : Windows Monitoring ( 5 Points) 
a.	What do you understand by the SYSVOL folder? What is EDB.Log? 
What is Res in Res1.log and Res2.log. 
b.	Define NTDS.DIT and EDB.Che. 
 a. 

SYSVOL Folder: SYSVOL stands for System Volume, and it's a shared directory that stores the server's copy of the domain's public files. These files include group policies, scripts for logon/logoff, and other system policies. SYSVOL is used in Active Directory environments to distribute these files to other domain controllers within the same domain. It plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency and synchronization among domain controllers.

EDB.Log: EDB.Log files are transaction log files used by Microsoft Exchange Server. Exchange Server utilizes a database engine called Extensible Storage Engine (ESE), which stores data in a database file (EDB file). The EDB.Log files contain transaction logs that record changes made to the Exchange database. These logs are crucial for ensuring data integrity and for facilitating database recovery in case of failures.

Res in Res1.log and Res2.log: "Res" likely stands for "Reserve" or "Reserved." In the context of Res1.log and Res2.log files, these are additional transaction log files used by Exchange Server. They may be created when the original transaction logs (EDB.Log files) reach a certain size limit or when the server is performing certain operations. These reserve log files provide a backup or additional space for transaction logging, ensuring that Exchange Server can continue to operate smoothly without running out of space for logging transactions.

b.

NTDS.DIT: NTDS.DIT stands for NT Directory Services Database Information Tree. It is the main database file for the Active Directory directory service on Windows-based operating systems. NTDS.DIT stores information about users, groups, computers, and other objects within an Active Directory domain. It is a crucial component of the Active Directory database and is essential for the functioning of the domain controller.
